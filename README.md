# TruEstate Retail Sales Management (Streaming-ready)

This repository contains a full-stack Retail Sales Management example with a **streaming backend** to handle very large CSV datasets without loading the entire file into memory.

**Use this project as a starting point for the TruEstate SDE Intern assignment.**

Folders:
- backend/ : Node.js + Express backend (streaming CSV)
- frontend/ : React (Vite) frontend
- docs/ : architecture documentation

**Important:** Place your large CSV file at `backend/src/data/sales_data.csv` before running the backend. See `backend/src/data/README.md` for expected columns.
